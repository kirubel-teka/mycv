<p class="title">4) Does it matter to use relative size(%,em,rem) one styling the size of an element so that the element is responsive ? Why ? [write your argument]</p>
<article>

<p>It actually matters to use relative size because they help you to achieve a harmoniuos and balanced design
According to W3C 1 rem unit is defined as equal to the font size of the html element of default value 16px 
When we look at em units the big problem here is that they are relative to the font size of their own element
As such they can cascade and cause unexpected results.On the other hand the main issue with using rem for
font sizing is that the values are somewhat difficult to use which makes them inconvenient for making calculations.

<P class="title">5) We said 16px is default browser width so what does it mean when we say 200px ? How does the browser interpret that ? </P>
<p>computing the font size we assume the root element's font size is 16px and every element with rem is relative to the root therefore the 
browser interprets this as 12.5 rem equals to 200px
</p>
<p class="title">6) Explain in detail(in technical terms) the specific changes in css3 </p>
<p>The latest version of css is designed to make new features shine.This version makes web development and documenting easier
    It provides an increased level of flexibility to make presentation of the web content easier to note some latest features
</p>
<h4>1) Box shadows</h4>
<p>This is a new feature that enables a content to slide under another area such as footer.The process is doesnt require javascript plugin</p>
<h4>2) CSS3 Selectors</h4>
<p>Here the selectors in the previous version have been updated and improved.Using these selectors,choosing DOM elements
    on the basis of their attributes is easy.No need to specify classes and IDs for every element instead using field elements for styling.
</p>
<h4>3) Font Additions</h4>
<p>Adding fonts in CSS3 is so easy simply link to your css file and choose the desired fonts you prefer.</p>
<h4>4) Rounded Corners</h4>
<p>This feature helps the designer for specifying height,width and positioning of multiple elements by providing us border-radius</p>
<h4>5) Border Images</h4>
<p>Another fantastic feature that came along with this css verison is the introduction of border images which makes you to 
    exchange border with images.
<h4>6) Opacity levels</h4>
<p>Earlier to this version designers needed to use css filters or other images to achieve the effects that they needed but in this version
    it is all able to be done with a single line of code 'opacity:1.5' to get desired effects.
</p>
<h4>7) Transform</h4>
<p>This function allows how big an area would become when hover.</p>
<h4>8) Text Shadow</h4>
<p>In the previous versions of css the designer has to either use an image or duplicate text element and then position it</p>
